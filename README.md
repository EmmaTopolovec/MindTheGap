### A basic RL implementation in a novel train platform environment using Gazebo Classic (v11), ROS 2 Humble, OpenAI gym, and stable-baselines3.

### By Emma Topolovec

### Created for Binghamton University, CS 524: Intelligent Mobile Robots

To run Gazebo:

$ colcon build

$ source install/setup.bash

$ ros2 launch my_turtlebot3_gazebo train_world.launch.py

To train a RL model:

$ python3 src/turtlebot3_rl/turtlebot3_rl/dynamic_rl.py
